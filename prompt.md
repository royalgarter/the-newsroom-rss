Review the index.html, when there many feeds & items, the Web UI is sluggy. I think because of the DOM depth and so many AlpineJS directive.

1. Introduce Virtual Scrolling: I'll modify the rendering of the feed items to only create and
  display the items that are currently visible in the viewport. As you scroll, old items will be
  removed from the DOM and new ones will be added. This is the most significant optimization and
  will drastically reduce the number of DOM elements, improving rendering speed and memory usage.
2. Simplify Intersection Observers: The current implementation uses multiple x-intersect directives
  on each item, which is inefficient. I'll simplify this by using a single intersection observer on
   the container to manage the items.
3. Reduce Template Logic: I'll move data formatting logic (like date formatting and text
  truncation) from the HTML template into the JavaScript part of the component. This
  pre-processing of data will make the rendering of the template faster.
